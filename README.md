# React Hooks: useState

![Hook](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2F68.media.tumblr.com%2F4abecc3bda7a596a142b27e0554fbeb1%2Ftumblr_oaued85JWK1vreqoxo6_r1_500.gif&f=1&nofb=1)

## Overview
In this lesson, we'll learn about how React manages state and a newer addition to React: Hooks! We'll talk about what Hooks are, and get some practice using one called `useState`.  We'll also build a simple ToDo List! Bangarang!

## Objectives
- Discuss the need for `state` in front-end applications
- Manipulate state within a React application
- Differentiate between state and props
- Discuss the need to share `state` across different parts of the application
- Share state across multiple React components
- Learn about Hooks in React
- Learn how we can use the hook `useState` to manage our state
- Implement `useState` to build a todo list

## Getting Started
- `Fork` and `Clone`
- `cd` into this folder
- `code .` and open in VSCode
- `npm i` to get our dependencies installed
- `npm start` to spin up our React App

## What is "State"? 

As we have seen in our exploration so far, most of our job as web developers centers around displaying, storing, and manipulating **data**. This data is rarely *static*, and nearly every action a user takes modifies some or all of the data. Because of this, the *shape* of our data is constantly changing as our application runs. Another word for the *shape* of our data at a given point in time is `state`.

Until now, we have stored `state` for HTML in global JS variables. We've used `JavaScript` to set and retrieve these values as we react to user input. This has worked out fine, but it requires quite a bit of work on our part. On top of that, the responsibility for handling our state has been shared between our HTML and Javascript files.

React gives us a much simpler way to manage this state, and it allows us to keep all of it inside of our Javascript alone.

## How does React manage state? 

Open your `TodoList.js` file and you'll see the following:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Tasks from './Tasks'
import Input from './Input'

const TodoList = () => {

  return (
    <div className="list">
      <Input />
      <Tasks tasks={[]} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default TodoList
```

Now you may be wondering how we can hold state here...

Let me introduce you to the `useState` hook!

The `useState` hook is a declarative way to manage state, each `useState` is in charge of managing it's own state! Let's see this in action. In order to utilize `useState`, we need to import it from React.

Modify your `React` import statement in your `TodoList.js` to the following:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
```

Next let's set up some state:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import Tasks from './Tasks'
import Input from './Input'

const TodoList = () => {

  const [tasks, manageTasks] = useState([])

  return (
    <div className="list">
      <Input />
      <Tasks tasks={[]} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default TodoList
```

Let's break this down:
- We're importing the `useState` hook from react *(It's built into the newer versions of the React library)*
- We're using some fancy code to gain access to two items, `tasks` and `manageTasks`. This is **[Array Destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)**.
- We're setting both of these items equal to `useState` which is a function *(all hooks are functions)* and initializing it with an empty array.

The `useState` hook provides us with two things: 1) a variable to access our state and 2) a method to manipulate it. The `manageTasks` method is directly in control of the `tasks` state. `useState` accepts an argument that sets our initial state, in this case an empty array.

## How is State different from Props?

In many ways State and Props operate similarly.  Both are plain JS Objects that hold data about your application and both of them trigger a render when they are updated.  However, there are some important differences between the two.

### Props Are Owned by any Parent Component, State is Owned (generally) by the App Component

- When we refer to Props, we're referring to the JSX "attributes" (properties) that have been passed down from a parent component. Like this:
  `<Movie title={"Blade Runner 2049"} year={2017} />`
- State is declared within a component.

### Props Are Immutable, State is Not

- It is impossible to directly change a components `prop` values. Props are `read-only` values
- State is able to be mutated (changed) via the method in the hook. More on that soon.

### State can be passed down into another component's Props, but not vice-versa

- We will often pass parts of a component's state down to child components.  The child gains the value in its own `props`
- Child components cannot pass state up to a parent (Remember Unidirectional Data Flow)

## Back to Our ToDo List

Now that we understand *what* state is, let's add some items to our initial state and pass these tasks to our `Tasks` component:

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import Tasks from './Tasks'
import Input from './Input'

const TodoList = () => {

  const [tasks, manageTasks] = useState([
    'Sweep the Floor',
    'Do Dishes',
    'Make Bed',
    'Feed the Dog'
  ])

  return (
    <div className="list">
      <Input />
      <Tasks tasks={tasks} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default TodoList
```

You'll notice we can directly access the `tasks` state via the `tasks` variable. That's the beauty of `hooks`: less code, more features! Be mindful, the downward data flow rule still applies, even with hooks!

## Setting State

Now that our components are all set up properly, let's add some items to our `tasks` state.
Start by creating two functions in your `TodoList` component:

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import Tasks from './Tasks'
import Input from './Input'

const TodoList = () => {

  const [tasks, manageTasks] = useState([
    'Sweep the Floor',
    'Do Dishes',
    'Make Bed',
    'Feed the Dog'
  ])

  const addTask = () => {}

  const handleChange = (event) => {}

  return (
    <div className="list">
      <Input />
      <Tasks tasks={tasks} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default TodoList
```

Let's pass these functions down to the correct components:
- `handleChange` should go to the `Input` component.
- `addTask` should go to the `Input` component.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import Tasks from './Tasks'
import Input from './Input'

const TodoList = () => {

  const [tasks, manageTasks] = useState([
    'Sweep the Floor',
    'Do Dishes',
    'Make Bed',
    'Feed the Dog'
  ])

  const addTask = () => {}

  const handleChange = (event) => {}

  return (
    <div className="list">
      <Input handleChange={handleChange} addTask={addTask} />
      <Tasks tasks={tasks} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default TodoList
```

Let's run a test with our `addTask` function, add in the following:

`addTask`:

```js
const addTask = () => {
  let myNewList = [...tasks, 'My Task']
  manageTasks(myNewList)
  console.log(tasks)
}
```

In your `Input.js` wire the `addTask` function to the button provided:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
const Input = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className="tasks">
      <label>Input Task: </label>
      <input type="text" name="task" />
      <button onClick={props.addTask}>Add</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Input
```

Try clicking the add button in your browser!

You should see `My Task` added to the list!

The `manageTask` function mutates the state it is associated with!

It accepts an argument of what we want to set a specific state to, the `manageTasks` is bound specifically to the `tasks` state and is the only function that can directly control it!

## You Do

Implement the following features:
- Create a new task utilizing the `Input` component. Hint: You may need another `useState`. The value of the input should be stored in this state. The `handleChange` function is there to help, **USE IT**.
- I should be able to add the newly typed task to our `tasks` state, half of this has already been done for you. ðŸ˜‰
- I should be able to remove a task from the `tasks` state, `splice` may be useful here! More on [`Array.splice()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice) Hint: You may want to add a button to each task as you `map` through it.

## Lesson Recap
In this lesson, we learned about State and how it differs from Props.  We learned how to change our State using our first React Hook: useState.  We created a cool ToDoList and used both a button and a form to modify our state! Remember, data is always passed down, not up.
